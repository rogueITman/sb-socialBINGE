<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a <a href="#">Elam's Estates LLC Account</a>, we can make those services even better – to show you <a class="highlight highlight-unselected" href="../../policies/privacy/example/more-relevant-search-results.html" id="more-relevant-search-results">more relevant search results</a> and ads, to help you <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/connect-with-people.html" id="connect-with-people">connect with people</a> or to make <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/sharing-with-others.html" id="sharing-with-others">sharing with others quicker and easier</a>. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
</p><p>Our Privacy Policy explains:
</p><ul>
<li>What information we collect and why we collect it.
</li><li>How we use that information.
</li><li>The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.</li></ul>
<p>We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/">key terms</a> first. Your privacy matters to Elam's Estates LLC so whether you are new to Elam's Estates LLC or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions <a href="https://support.Elam's Estates LLC.com/policies/troubleshooter/2990837?hl=en">contact us</a>.

<h2 id="infocollect">Information we collect</h2>

<h2 id="infouse">How we use information we collect</h2>
<p>We use the information we collect from all of our services to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/provide-services.html" id="provide-services">provide</a>, <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/maintain-services.html" id="maintain-services">maintain</a>, <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/protect-services.html" id="protect-services">protect</a> and improve them, to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/develop-new-ones.html" id="develop-new-ones">develop new ones</a>, and to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/protect-Elam's Estates LLC-and-our-users.html" id="protect-Elam's Estates LLC-and-our-users">protect Elam's Estates LLC and our users</a>. We also use this information to offer you tailored content – like giving you more relevant search results and ads.
</p><p>We may use the name you provide for your Elam's Estates LLC Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Elam's Estates LLC Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Elam's Estates LLC Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Elam's Estates LLC Profile information, such as your name and photo.
</p><p>If you have a Elam's Estates LLC Account, we may display your Profile name, Profile photo, and actions you take on Elam's Estates LLC or on third-party applications connected to your Elam's Estates LLC Account (such as +1’s, reviews you write and comments you post) in our services, including displaying in ads and other commercial contexts. We will respect the choices you make to <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings.html" id="limit-sharing-or-visibility-settings">limit sharing or visibility settings</a> in your Elam's Estates LLC Account.

One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Elam's Estates LLC Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we’ll be able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or similar technologies with <a href="../../policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-sensitive-categories">sensitive categories</a>, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.
</p><p>Our automated systems analyze your content (including emails) to provide you personally relevant product features, such as customized search results, tailored advertising, and spam and malware detection.
</p><p>We may <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/combine-personal-information.html" id="combine-personal-information">combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Elam's Estates LLC services</a> – for example <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/to-make-it-easier-to-share.html" id="to-make-it-easier-to-share">to make it easier to share things with people you know</a>.

<h2 id="infochoices">Transparency and choice</h2>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://myaccount.Elam's Estates LLC.com/privacy?hl=en#accounthistory">Review and update your Elam's Estates LLC activity controls</a> to decide what types of data, such as videos you’ve watched on YouTube or past searches, you would like saved with your account when you use Elam's Estates LLC services.

<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it’s important to remember that many of our services <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/may-not-function-properly.html" id="may-not-function-properly">may not function properly</a> if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.
</p><div class="pp-top-link"><a class="gweb-smoothscroll-control" href="#content">Back to top</a></div>
<h2 id="infosharing">Information you share</h2>
<p>Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Elam's Estates LLC. Our services provide you with different options on <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/sharing.html" id="sharing">sharing</a> and <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/removing-your-content.html" id="removing-your-content">removing your content</a>.
</p><div class="pp-top-link"><a class="gweb-smoothscroll-control" href="#content">Back to top</a></div>
<h2 id="access">Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>
<p>Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/access-to-your-personal-information.html" id="access-to-your-personal-information">access to your personal information</a>. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.
</p><p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).
</p><p>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
</p><div class="pp-top-link"><a class="gweb-smoothscroll-control" href="#content">Back to top</a></div>

</p><p>If Elam's Estates LLC is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</p><div class="pp-top-link"><a class="gweb-smoothscroll-control" href="#content">Back to top</a></div>
<h2 id="infosecurity">Information security</h2>

</li><li>We restrict access to personal information to Elam's Estates LLC employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li></ul>
